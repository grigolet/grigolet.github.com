# Gianluca Rigoletti

I am a senior fellow physicist working at CERN. My current work if focused around the maintenance and operation of gas systems for particle detectors. A significant part of this work consists of engineering and sizing gas systems, but also develop the industrial control software
required to operate the plants. I also work a lot with python to wrangle, analyze and visualize data from such systems.
Another part of my activities is revolves around the study of different strategies to reduce Greenhouse gas emissions from particle
detectors. This could go from optimizing current gas systems to test alternative gases for particle detectors employing impactful greenhouse gases.

I have few hobbies I am taking care of in my free time:

- Making pizza: since 2019 I started to be systematic in the way I cook pizza as I wanted to try my best to achieve a good napolitean pizza at my place.
- IoT devices for plants based experiments. I test time to times micro controllers and different sensors to grow some herbs in my indoor gardens.
- Eating and cooking: I particularly enjoy eating in places putting their best effort in sustainability of their product. I am a big lovers of tomatoes growing in the middle of Italy
- Few other things I can't think of right now


I am blogging in English but I speak Italian and a bit of French as well.
