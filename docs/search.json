    "text": "The problem of visualizing many series\nAssuming we have a very simple set of \\((x, y_n)\\) series a simple plot with matplotlib may look like this:\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport random as rnd\n\nx = range(100)\ny1 = [rnd.random() for i in x]\ny2 = [rnd.random() * 10 for i in x]\ny3 = [rnd.random() * 20 + 10 for i in x]\ny4 = [rnd.random() * 100 + 50 for i in x]\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nfor y in [y1, y2, y3, y4]:\n    ax.plot(x, y, '.-')\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A matplotlib plot with four series plotted together.\n\n\n\n\nNote that in Figure Figure 1 each time series has a different standard deviation, thus different ranges may be needed. This is often easily accomplished by plotting each series in a different subplots. However, subplots make it more difficult to visually compare and align series, especially when time-based. For example, see subplots here:\n\nx = range(100)\ny1 = [rnd.random() if i < 30 else rnd.random() + 1 for i in x]\ny2 = [rnd.random() * 10 if i < 33 else rnd.random() * 10 + 10 for i in x]\ny3 = [rnd.random() * 20 + 10 if i < 30 else rnd.random() * 20 + 30 for i in x]\ny4 = [rnd.random() * 100 + 50 if i < 27 else rnd.random() * 100 + 180 for i in x]\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nfor y in [y1, y2, y3, y4]:\n    ax.plot(x, y, '.-')\n\n\n\n\nMultiple series with an offset at arbitrary x.\n\n\n\n\nHere I have added an offset to each series. Two series, y1 and y3 have a change point at the same index, while the other two have a change point at slightly different xs. We could plot each series in a subplots, perhaps vertically stacked:\n\nseries = [y1, y2, y3, y4]\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(len(series), 1, figsize=(6, 4*len(series)))\nfor ix, y in enumerate(series):\n    ax = axs.flat[ix]\n    ax.plot(x, y, '.-')\n    ax.set_title(f'y{ix+1}')\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Series plotted on different subplots.\n\n\n\n\nIn figure Figure 2 you can see that each series as an offset when adding a proper range on the y axis. However, it is still a bit difficult to understand the real indexes of the offset. I would like to understand which come first and which comes later.\n\n\nAdding multiple Y axes to matplotlib plots\nWe can starting adding multiple axes by taking inspiration from the Matplotib documentation using spines, Parasite Axes and another Parasite axis demo.\nThe idea is to use ax.twinx() to create an additional axes. As the documentation says, > Create a new Axes with an invisible x-axis and an independent y-axis positioned opposite to the original one (i.e. at right).\nAlthough twinx() is used to create a secondary axis on the right position I could use it to create a secondary axis and leave the spines of the axis only on the left. I can use set_position() on the spines object to shift the spines on left:\n\nfig, ax1 = plt.subplots()\nax2 = ax1.twinx()\nax3 = ax1.twinx()\nax4 = ax1.twinx()\naxs = [ax1, ax2, ax3, ax4]\n\nfor ix, (ax, y) in enumerate(zip(axs, series)):\n    ax.plot(x, y, label=f'y{ix}', color=f'C{ix}')\nax.legend();\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Single plot with multiple series and secondary axes.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see in Figure Figure 3 we can understand the index at which each change point of the series is happening. The only issue is that the y axes on the right are overlapping between each other.\nMy goal is to have these secondary y-axes on the left for easier reading. Actually, if you inspect the source of how twinx() is defined, it calls Axes._make_twin_axes() and sets later the tick position on the right using YAxis.tick_right() and YAxis.set_label_position('right'). It would be nice if twinx() would not assume that we want the axes to the right and instead allowed to pass a parameter which decised the position.\nHere below I leave a minimum working example I could think of:\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots()\nfor ix, y in enumerate(series):\n    # If we have to plot the first series we use \n    # The axes created by plt.subplots() earlier\n    if ix == 0: \n        ax = axes\n    else:\n        # It's not the first series: we need to\n        # create a twin axes\n        ax = axes.twinx()\n    # Set the ticks of the axis to the left\n    ax.yaxis.tick_left()\n    # Set the labels of the axes to the lef\n    ax.yaxis.set_label_position('left')\n    ax.yaxis.set_offset_position('left')\n    # Offset the position of he ticks and labels\n    # by some % of the axes avoid overlapping of axes\n    ax.spines['left'].set_position(('outward', 40 * ix))\n    # Plot the actual data\n    ax.plot(x, y, color=f'C{ix}')\n    ax.spines['left'].set_color(f'C{ix}')\n    ax.tick_params(axis='y', colors=f'C{ix}')\n\n\n\n\nEt voilà, here I have a plot similar to the WinCC-OA one. I could improve the plot a bit by using the same number of ticks for each axes. I would do this using the LinearLocator class:\n\n\nCode\nimport matplotlib.ticker as mt\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots()\nfor ix, y in enumerate(series):\n    # If we have to plot the first series we use \n    # The axes created by plt.subplots() earlier\n    if ix == 0: \n        ax = axes\n    else:\n        # It's not the first series: we need to\n        # create a twin axes\n        ax = axes.twinx()\n    # Set the ticks of the axis to the left\n    ax.yaxis.tick_left()\n    # Set the labels of the axes to the left\n    ax.yaxis.set_label_position('left')\n    ax.yaxis.set_offset_position('left')\n    # Offset the position of he ticks and labels\n    # by some % of the axes avoid overlapping of axes\n    ax.spines['left'].set_position(('outward', 40 * ix))\n    # Plot the actual data\n    ax.plot(x, y, color=f'C{ix}')\n    # Set the colors of the ticks, labels and spines to be\n    # the same of the associated series\n    ax.spines['left'].set_color(f'C{ix}')\n    ax.tick_params(axis='y', colors=f'C{ix}')\n    # Use a tick locator to have the same number of ticks\n    ax.yaxis.set_major_locator(mt.LinearLocator(11))\n    # And format the labels to have only one digit after the decimals\n    ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(mt.StrMethodFormatter('{x:.1f}'))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nI find very useful for myself to provide a minimal example of having a plot with multiple axes, though a final plot may require more subtle adjustements. Keypoints to have multiple y axes:\n\nUse twinx() to create an additional axis\nSet ticks, labels and offest positions to the right: ax.yaxis.tick_left(), ax.yaxis.set_label_position('left'), ax.yaxis.set_offset_position('left')\nAdjust the offset of the spines to the left using points, percentage or data coordinate. In the case of points: ax.spines['left'].set_position()\nChange spines, tick and label colors to the same of the series for better readability: ax.spines['left'].set_color(color), ax.tick_params(axis='y', colors=color)\nOptionally adjust the number of ticks to be the same for all the axes: use a LinearLocator class with a fixed number of points"

    "text": "Few days ago I found Quarto. I understood it is an authoring framework based on pandoc and that has full support of jupyter notebooks as input files. Since lot of work I carry on at the moment makes a heavy use of jupyter notebook I decided to try Quarto and use it for two main purposes: the first is as a replacement of jupyter nbconvert that I have intensively used to convert notebooks to html pages.\nI saw that Quarto provides much more flexibility on the layout of the text, images and code, which was exactly what I was looking for. The second way I intend to use Quarto is to publish the present content. At the time of writing, this post is written on an index.ipynb file in my local computer using Visual Studio code. I find extremely pleasant to write mixed content and have a tool that transforms it in a post page of a blog website.\nI will showcase here all the features that I have personally found relevant for the posts I am going to write as well, hoping that this post serves as a quick reference (together with the Quarto user guide)."

    "text": "Code cells\nCode cells are pretty straightforward: I just have to write code in a cell and it will be executed and the output eventually frozen by Quarto. I found the freeze option particularly useful and I set it to auto at the time of writing. In this way, the notebooks will be re-rendered only if the source code changes.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd \nimport numpy as np\n\nAt the very base you can just enter some code and save it. If you are using quarto preview the jupyter notebook is executed when it saved (and not when a code cell is executed, but this depends on the saving options of jupyter).\nFor instance, we can write some code and let it display some output like this:\n\nclass TestClass:\n    def __init__(self, params) -> None:\n        self.attributes = params\n    \n    def increment(self, param: int) -> int:\n        return param + 1\n\nobj = TestClass('test')\nobj.increment(10)\n\n11\n\n\nSometimes a cell may contain lot of code that makes it difficult for the reader to keep track of the text. In this case folding the code is very helpful and only requires a special comment to be added at the beginning of the code cell:\n#| code-fold: true\n\nclass TestClass:\n    def __init__(self, params) -> None:\n        self.attributes = params\n    \n    def increment(self, param: int) -> int:\n        return param + 1\n\nobj = TestClass('test')\nobj.increment(10)\nHere below the result of the previous snippet of code:\n\n\nCode\nclass TestClass:\n    def __init__(self, params) -> None:\n        self.attributes = params\n    \n    def increment(self, param: int) -> int:\n        return param + 1\n\nobj = TestClass('test')\nobj.increment(10)\n\n\n11\n\n\nNote that the output of the cell is not folded. This is particularly useful if you have lot of code printing out a plot for example: the code will be folded but the plot will be visible anyway.\nSome other time I wish to completely hide the code while keeping the output visible. In this case the option echo: false does the job:\n#| echo: false\nplt.plot([1,2,3], [4,5,6], 'ro');\nHere below the result of the previous snippet of code:\n\n\n\n\n\nCode cells can be also assigned a file name. This is particularly helpful when there is a post that needs to tackle code among several files. As an example you can have something like:\n#| filename: test.py\n\nclass A:\n    pass\nAnd this would be rendered to:\n\n\n\ntest.py\n\nclass A:\n    pass"

    "text": "Controlling figures layout\nI find particularly useful the way Quarto helps treating outputs for code cells, especially laying out figures resulting from a code output. Often times I have big plots that I would like to take all the available horizontal space in the page. In this case I can use #| column: page together with on the code cell\n#| column: page\n#| fig-align: center\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5), dpi=150)\nax.plot(range(10), [1,2,3,2,1,2,2,31,1,2])\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also support for custom layouts when multiple plots are produced. I typically use matplotlib APIs to lay out multiple plots but this features could be useful for images in general and sometimes with libraries where the layout support for subplots is not straightforward. As an example see this snippet:\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot([1,2,3,4], [4,3,2,3], 'ro-')\n\nfig2, ax2 = plt.subplots()\nax2.plot([1,2,3,4], [4,3,1,32], 'b*--')"
